<p>Industry: Business Management<br />
Location: USA<br />
Headquarters: USA</p>
<p><b>Campaign Type</b></p>
<p>Appointment Setting</p>
<p><b>Campaign Target Criteria</b></p>
<p>Location: Entire US<br />
Industries: B2B Trading with AR US$100M to 2B<br />
Decision makers: COO, CFO, CIO, IT/Technology Director, Head of Purchasing, Head of Customer Service</p>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>The Client is a leading provider of Cloud Integration and Supply Chain Integration Solutions. The services they provide help businesses simplify integration, automate processes and improve collaboration and visibility to global trading partners.</p>
<p>Originally founded in 2005 as a B2B-focused consulting firm, they later evolved, acquired and developed key technologies to address the growing needs of collaboration in businesses worldwide.</p>
<p><b>The Challenge</b></p>
<p>Despite working with some providers whom the Client relied on in getting new business, finding <b><i>interested companies</i></b> <b><i>to engage with their services for the long term</i></b> was a challenge. The Client figured out that the issue was rooted in two causes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Contacts that weren’t fully</i></b> <b><i>profiled. </i></b>Most of their current customers may not be the <i>best candidates to maximize the whole range of collaboration solutions the Client has to offer and sign on with the Client for longer contract periods. </i></li>
<li><b><i>Lack of probing efforts to uncover the need from prospects </i></b>like, which integration solutions would best fit to integrate and automate their business processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the hope to find key solutions to the problem, the Client searched for another marketing provider &#8211; a lead generation/appointment setting company who can provide them with a list of <b><i>accurate contacts</i></b><i> and </i><b><i>quality appointments </i></b>with interested prospects who have the <b><i>need </i></b>for cloud integration and supply chain solution services, and who would most likely keep <b><i>a long-term engagement</i></b> with them.</p>
<p><b>The Solution</b></p>
<p>Past experiences with providers who delivered <i>less qualified appointments</i> have made the Client become quite skeptical about what Callbox’s multi-channel marketing campaign program can do to better their current business status. For them, the first 3-month campaign term they signed up was a “test”, but for Callbox, as always, it was a “commitment”.</p>
<p>In order to address the Client&#8217;s challenges on <i>contact accuracy </i>and <i>quality of appointments,</i> the team carried out their best effort to <b><i>profile and update </i></b>each contact information with each call, and took the opportunity to <i>ask decision makers</i><b><i> appropriate probing questions</i></b> to uncover business needs. These were significant factors in generating <i>high converting appointments</i>.</p>
<p>To make these processes continuously run throughout the whole campaign period, the Callbox team employed the <b><i>Callbox Pipeline Lead Nurture Tool</i></b> which efficiently automated tasks that streamlined the workflow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact profiling was efficiently processed through the Lead Nurture Tool’s <b><i>list cleansing</i></b> feature, by automatically sending invalid contacts to support lists for the research team to wash and update.</li>
<li><b><i>Custom emails</i></b><i> were automatically sent</i> to prospects in a scheduled manner. The actions taken by prospects like clicking a website or submitting a form, sent real time alerts to the caller to promptly respond or call them.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The Callbox Pipeline Lead Nurture Tool was vital in keeping the calling list accurate throughout the whole campaign duration, and broadened the chance for the caller to reach the right prospects at the right time, when they are most available to talk, thus resulting to a very impressive turnover at each end term: </i></p>
<p>1st term (3 months) &#8211; 49 appointments (4 seats)<br />
2nd term (5 months) &#8211; 94 appointments (4seats)<br />
3rd term (3 months) &#8211; 197 appointments<br />
4th term (3months) &#8211; 360 appointments</p>
<p><em><i>“Another good one, good fit. Keep em coming. A little small, but they have the need for sure.” </i></em></p>
<p><em><i>“I&#8217;m happy with the leads for these past couple of days. Just had a call with (company) earlier and it was a very good call. Good job!”</i></em></p>
<p><em><i>“Another good call. Sending an initial proposal over now”</i></em></p>
<p><em><i>“There was a great improvement on the quality of the leads for the past couple of months.”</i></em></p>
<p><b>The Benefits</b></p>
<p>With Callbox’s <b><i>skillful profiling</i></b> methods, the Client now keeps a well-profiled list of contacts &#8211; customers who fully require collaborative commerce solutions; and through <b><i>intensive probing</i></b>, the team was able to uncover business needs. This has helped the Client tailor the best solutions for customers and get them to sign up for longer term contracts.</p>
<p>The Callbox multi-channel marketing campaign which was dynamically carried out by the Pipeline Lead Nurture Tool, added <b><i>10% to the Client’s recurring revenue </i></b>of 5%.</p>
<p>Currently, they are <b><i>nurturing 128 leads</i></b>, <b>10 of which have received proposals</b> and <b>2 have recently signed sales contracts (apart from the previous closed deals)</b>, and still seeing further successes to come in 2016.</p>
<p><b><i>The Client greatly acknowledges Callbox’s best efforts to unleash their business potentials and achieve their goals.</i></b></p>
<p><i>“It has allowed us to focus on what we do best instead of cold calling or generating lists. Callbox is very efficient in these areas and has economies of scale that we simply cannot produce on our own.” </i><br />
<b><i>A well-profiled contact list, high converting qualified appointments, upscaled sales revenue and long-term business engagements &#8211; </i></b>all these have reversed the Client&#8217;s skeptical view on Callbox’s Multi-Channel Marketing Program from a mere “test” into a “trustful” business partnership.</p>
