<p><strong>Campaign Type : </strong>Lead Generation</p>
<div>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>The campaign’s initial run in April 2011 mainly focused on the Singapore market. The client preferred to cater to companies that send out big files. These are companies that have worldwide presence and do site-to-site file sending, or those that require file-sharing with their resellers or customers.</p>
<p>The initial campaign production delivered 19 leads. Such number was instrumental to the client’s positive decision to renew for another campaign that was even more impressive with 34 leads. Since then, the team continuously worked on for the lead generation campaign. The number of leads fluctuated but nevertheless quality was maintained at its best. The following campaign period brought in 28 leads with positive contacts at 63%, the next with 26 leads at 50% positive contacts, followed by another month with 35 leads at 71% positive contacts, and proceeded to another renewal month with 14 leads at 71% positive contacts and the last month with 23 leads at 76% positive contacts.</p>
<p>As the Singapore database was close to being exhausted, Callbox proposed to the client to divert its focus to other countries. In 2012, Malaysia came into the picture and kicked off with 30 leads in the 1st run, and went on alternately running MY and SG markets for the rest of the campaign period, with 18-20 leads per month, renewing contract after contract of 3 or 6 months, until the final leg in May 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges Encountered</strong></p>
<p><em>Quality vs. Quantity</em></p>
<p>The campaign required the Callbox team more effort compared with the other campaigns. The leads that were passed were strictly qualified based on the set criteria, which were subjected to the client’s scrutiny and approval.</p>
<p><em>Database Use</em></p>
<p>The 4-year run made the most of its target database of contacts. Towards the end of the last 2 months of the campaign, both the Malaysia and Singapore databases went all in, as both target markets have been saturated, yet the campaign was still able to produce 18 leads at the least.</p>
<p><strong>What A Difference It Has Made</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the most successful and longest running campaigns in Callbox. But how was this huge success achieved?</p>
<p><em>The client truthfully engaged himself with the campaign by sharing full</em> <em>product knowledge with the team by conducting a thorough training</em> <em>on the product specifications, features and usage benefits.</em></p>
<p>The Callbox team had a first-hand experience of the product as they were able to practically navigate its interface which helped the calling agent efficiently position the offer to the prospects. These best practices also made the leaders effectively coach the caller on the challenges encountered in the calls, making them able to easily address issues that arise from day to day calling.</p>
<p><em>All available resources in Callbox were utilized.</em></p>
<p>Calling, sending of emails and other marketing resources like the social media were substantial to the exceptional results of the campaign.<br />
Definitely, this campaign has made history with Callbox.</p>
