This is why redundancy and reliability are so important to business process outsourcing. We have worked hard to analyze and address every plane of failure in order to make Callbox teams and systems as reliable as your own. Always a phone call away 24/7/365. It’s your project. It’s your peace of mind.</p>\n<p>First rate connectivity. First rate redundancy. You can count on Callbox.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Redundant Security</strong><br />\nAn independent security company admits only identified staff and logs each. All agent passwords are asymmetric encrypted. A closed network between all facilities never allows processing data on the internet. Any client data sits behind our proprietary custom-built triple firewall.</li>\n<li><strong>Redundant Telecommunication</strong><br />\nMultiple E1 lines from every top-tier publicly traded leased line provider in the country give us both redundancy and on-tap impulse capacity. The Level 3 IP network is one of the most advanced networks available, offering best-in-class service level agreements (99.99% uptime) and some of the highest access call center speeds in the industry today.</li>\n<li><strong>Redundant Network : Isolated Data, Dedicated Voice</strong><br />\nOur voice and data networks never run on the same track. Callbox is engineered for cutting edge telephony from the ground up. Our data-LANs and voice-LANs and switches are completely isolated ensuring your phone calls sound like phone calls – no static, no echo, no delay. Our switches are pooled, talk to each other on their own voice-LAN, and log to a common database.</li>\n<li><strong>Redundant Workstations, Dedicated Support</strong><br />\nWe own, operate, and service 100% of our IT, network, and telco equipment. All support is dedicated, in-house, 24/7. No 3rd-party licensing, provisioning, registration, up-staffing, repair issues. None. Callbox is a single-source large-scale telemarketing provider of comprehensive call center overage. We enforce 24-month turnover on all agent hardware. You can be sure your agents are on the fastest computers with the latest phones, headsets, and networking gear. No laptops. No soft-phones.</li>\n<li><strong>Redundant Facilities and Power</strong><br />\nDual call facilities at different addresses, each with its own dedicated back-up generator, allow us to migrate tier-1 clients in under 2 hours in case of localized catastrophe.</li>\n<li><strong>Redundant Inbound Carriers</strong><br />\nWe can secure any quantity of phone numbers in almost any area code you need, including toll-free, in under a week; often in a day. A secure web interface allows instant DID fail-over redirection or rebalancing across any number of carriers.</li>\n<li><strong>PipelineCRM Real time Reports</strong><br />\nCallbox provides real time campaign data to all our clients via secure web interface. PipelineCRM is your own private web-based customer relationship and sales force management tool that integrates Callbox call center power and enables your managers and sales professionals to streamline your business development.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Call Recording</strong><br />\nCall recording is an integrated part of our system. All recordings can be available in .wav format through your secure PipelineCRM© website.</li>\n<li><strong>Maximized Outbound Throughput</strong><br />\nOur switches do all the dialing automatically and continuously, to feed the dedicated agents on your outbound campaign a systematic stream of connects, always keeping the energy and success high.Accounts opting to use our proprietary predictive dialing system benefit from automatic pacing, maximizing Contacts Per Hour and minimizing abandoned calls while agents are added to or removed from the campaign, on the fly.</li>\n<li><strong>Unequalled Inbound Flexibility</strong><br />\nHave every call answered by an agent on the first ring, or design a call processing tree as sophisticated as you like, branching on CallerID, current customer field values, IVR, DNIS, time in queue, time of day, etc. Our switches are not constrained to any third party feature set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Callbox, you don’t have to worry about underestimating your inbound call volume. Why? There is no risk of waiting for or rushing 3rd-party hardware vendors to install additional capacity. Take the peril out of your customer call center selection. It’s ok to get more calls than you expect! If we already have a campaign running, it’s as simple as plugging in more servers to play more seats. Legacy call centers cannot offer this.</p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_91' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"our-technology","date":"January 21, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"400eca55-a72d-54a4-badc-42e155ee632d"}}
