Based in London, UK, the Client serves a stable of more than 1500 corporate clients in 40 countries, with over 1 million users worldwide.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The Client was seeking to drive attendees to its Microsoft SharePoint Seminar in London. Its immediate goal was to produce high quality sign-ups. However, the overall objective was to generate and deliver to its inside sales team sales resources that are fully-qualified and with near-term requirement for the products it offers. The Client had no experience in outsourcing its marketing function, and the result of this campaign would determine whether or not it would consider similar projects in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>Callbox had an excellent campaign with the Client’s main branch in the US, and was recommended by the latter to its UK branch. The client hired Callbox to make outbound calls to invite prospects to its Microsoft SharePoint Seminar in London. Callbox started calling on February 15, 2011, targeting CEOs, CIOs, CFOs, and Finance, and Operations Managers outside London. This campaign was a huge challenge for the team as it involved inviting prospects to an event that would require them to travel for several hours mostly by land.</p>\n<p>With two weeks left in the project, Callbox proposed an integrated two-phase campaign to make a shift from event invitation to lead generation marketing to which the client agreed. The Callbox team proceeded with the lead generation campaign right away, focusing on promoting the client’s workflow application for the police and fire services around London, UK area. Callbox was able to mine the Client’s existing contacts database to identify hundreds of potential customers. This campaign targeted IT Managers, ICT, CIOs, HOD ITs, and IT Directors.</p>\n<p>Throughout the campaign, Callbox communicated regularly with the Client through PipelineCRM, which allowed the Client to monitor campaign progress in real-time.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the difficulties encountered during the campaign, Callbox was able to produce significant  results for the Client.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15 qualified leads in 22 calling days</li>\n<li>412 positive contacts out of 1912 (22% contact rate)</li>\n<li>38 contacts scheduled for follow-up</li>\n<li>55 requested for additional information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional benefits of this campaign include enhanced brand and product awareness, and acquisition of business intelligence and other significant data about the Client’s market. Most notably, this campaign inspired the Client to consider a change in marketing practices with outsourcing.</p>\n<p>Needing more time to close the leads, the Client decided to put the campaign on hold, but expressed willingness to run another lead generating project with Callbox in the near future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_SW_Integrated-Campaign-for-UK's-Leading-Workflow-Automation-Solution.pdf\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_52' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"integrated-campaign-for-uks-leading-workflow-automation-solution","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c9b1eae3-980f-5ddb-b7a3-4e8b7d4f84d9"}}
