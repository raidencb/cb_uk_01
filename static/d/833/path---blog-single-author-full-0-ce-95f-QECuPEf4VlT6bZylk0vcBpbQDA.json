Therefore, targeting customers and exploring new markets will not salt away businesses from spending big money.

If we ask marketers today about the best way to engage potential clients, they would say “<span style=\"color: #993300;\"><a style=\"color: #993300;\" title=\"9 Undeniable Advantages of Using Personalized Content in Your Marketing\" href=\"http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33971/9-Undeniable-Advantages-of-Using-Personalized-Content-in-Your-Marketing.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">personalised content</a></span>” right off the bat.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">This is true regardless of a B2B company’s location and target audience. In the United Kingdom that is home to thousands of enterprises catering to a variety of industries, relevant and industry-specific content is the hottest thing since Benedict Cumberbatch.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">But we’re not going to discuss that now (and especially not Cumberbatch). The most important concern right now is whether a B2B company in the UK is able to harness personalised content effectively. A recent survey shows a very bleak outlook.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">B2BMareketing.net found out that 56 percent of 122 companies in the UK say they are struggling with personalised content, declaring that <strong><em>“</em></strong></span><em>they do not tailor content based on the buyers&#8217; journey, while just 16 per cent are able to identify individual profiles and serve them content based on their specific position.</em><strong><em>”</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">So even if we absorb all this hype about personalised content in the UK, we are at most unaware of the actual realities that are currently at play. The survey implies that more than half of B2B companies lack a full understanding of creating content with high value to potential clients.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_11268\" style=\"width: 468px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a title=\"How to Conquer Complex Content Distribution for Lead Generation\" href=\"http://www.callboxinc.com/lead-generation/how-to-conquer-complex-content-distribution-for-lead-generation/\" target=\"_blank\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11268\" class=\"wp-image-11268\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-to-Conquer-Complex-Content-Distribution-for-Lead-Generation.jpg\" alt=\"How-to-Conquer-Complex-Content-Distribution-for-Lead-Generation\" width=\"458\" height=\"212\" srcset=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-to-Conquer-Complex-Content-Distribution-for-Lead-Generation.jpg 605w, http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-to-Conquer-Complex-Content-Distribution-for-Lead-Generation-300x138.jpg 300w, http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/How-to-Conquer-Complex-Content-Distribution-for-Lead-Generation-450x208.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-11268\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em><strong>Related post:</strong></em> <strong><em>How to Conquer Complex Content Distribution for Lead Generation</em></strong></p></div>\n<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>But of course, problems like this can be avoided.

It may sound easy, but imagine managing hundreds – or maybe thousands – of these individual decision-makers!</p>\n<p>From telecommunications down to healthcare, B2B companies are unable to market their products and services effectively because of the fact that they are given a large volume of leads to pursue makes it all the more difficult to create messages that conform to the preferences of each one.</p>\n<p>Because of this, marketers usually turn to better tactics to maximize their lead generation and appointment setting. One of these is <b>audience segmentation</b>.</p>\n<p>To drive the point home, segmentation allows marketers to organize their campaigns by simply segregating their audiences into manageable groups based on demographic variables such as company size, budget, location, name and associated industry.</p>\n<p>Specific advantages include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b> Better Revenue. </b>Segmentation entails a massive spike in revenue, mostly because it involves engaging decision-makers who will sense the most value from your offers and have a greater chance at purchasing your product.</li>\n<li><b> Savings. </b>Sending emails and conducting cold calls to generate B2B leads can cost you a ton of money. But with a segmented marketing list, you will be able to eliminate the possibility of send to the wrong prospects, thus resulting in dramatically bringing marketing costs down.</li>\n<li><b> Audience building. </b>Forming long-term partnerships with potential clients is easier once you deliver the kind of messages they want to hear. By presenting targeted messages to the proper personalities, you will in a way get closer to your audience.</li>\n<li><b> Personalized and valuable messaging. </b>It would sound redundant at this point, but let us all agree that segmentation is effective because it allows for the production of messages that are closer to actual issues faced by potential clients.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a title=\"Lead Generation and Appointment Setting\" href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/services/telemarketing/appointment-setting-lead-generation/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff9900;\">Lead generation</span></strong></a> is not always your typical cup of tea as the process involves more than three steps in order to come up with an effective marketing campaign.
