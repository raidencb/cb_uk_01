Founded in 2009, the company was named a silver winner in the Enterprise Product of the Year in Best in Biz Awards 2011, and the Wall Street Journal 2012 Technology Innovation Awards. It was also selected for the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span><em>Red Herring</em><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>Top 100 Americas Award in 2012, and was among the top 25 best places to work in Silicon Valley.</p>\n<p><b>The Challenge</b></p>\n<p>In January 2014, the Client hired Callbox for an appointment setting campaign targeting decision makers from Fortune 1000 companies in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. With its market rapidly growing, the company scheduled an official launching of its Singapore office in May of the same year, and organized an RSVP campaign.</p>\n<p>About a week before the event, the company realized that it was coming up short of its goal of 80 registrations. The company’s country manager for Singapore approached Callbox to run an event telemarketing campaign, with a goal to come up with 17 additional leads to complete its initial goal of 80 registrations.</p>\n<p>With only two days to plan and execute the campaign, the challenge for Callbox was to develop a quick and engaging approach in order to generate as many confirmed registrations as possible, while carefully considering the Client’s qualification requirements.</p>\n<div>\n<p><b>The Callbox Solution</b></p>\n<p>The overall effort began on May 14 and involved two phases: 1) creating and segmenting a calling list, and 2) setting up an RSVP campaign through outbound telemarketing.</p>\n<p>The goal of the entire campaign was three-fold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To create awareness of company and its technology</li>\n<li>To provide information about the event (date, venue, etc.)</li>\n<li>To register qualified leads (i.e., confirmed RSVPs)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Time was of the essence in this campaign so Callbox made sure to keep the outreach highly targeted, supplementing the Client’s calling list with its own segmented contact database. This allowed the team to focus on pre-qualified targets, achieving a 35% positive contact rate, instead of wasting its limited time calling contacts that fell outside its target market.</p>\n</div>\n<p><b>The Results</b></p>\n<p>In just two days of actual calling, Callbox completed the required number of registrations, hitting the Client’s target right on the nose, and exceeding its attendance projection by a significant margin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>17 additional leads (confirmed RSVPs)</li>\n<li>57 attendees excluding members of the press (Client’s projection was 40)</li>\n<li>10 press members attending the press briefing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From this campaign, Callbox also left the Client’s inside sales team with 78 leads to follow-up, including 12 who requested for additional information.</p>\n<p>High-profile companies at the event included StarHub, Global Foundries, Bank of America, and Maybank Singapore, among others. After the campaign, the Client re-contracted for an appointment setting campaign with Callbox.</p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_38' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"upstart-storage-company-beats-launching-turnout-target-in-a-flash","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"1f92c216-7ee8-5a56-ba6e-80ccc040f042"}}
