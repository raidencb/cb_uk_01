The Client configures talent solutions for specific business needs to dramatically improve business performance. They provide on demand talent management solutions to assess, acquire, develop, and align workforce.</p>\n<p>The Client delivers a comprehensive suite of solutions for businesses of all sizes, matching all sources of talent – be they professional and hourly candidates, agency referrals, campus recruits, contingent workers, or existing employees to all positions, whether it is centralized, decentralized, or multinational. It maintains its headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area and a research and development facility in Quebec City, where the company employs approximately 300 people focused solely on talent management applications.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The Client needed to invite prospects to its 2007 World conference. Its desired attendees were composed of its current customer base and prospects from all over the US culled from their in-house database.</p>\n<p>This global company needed a reliable partner to update and manage its lists and gather pertinent information such as names of decision makers, email addresses and phone numbers, company names, addresses and zip codes. Using the lists from their database, the Client needed to generate interest and drive attendance to their event.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>The Callbox team broke the challenge down into distinct implementation phases:<br />\nDatabase Cleanup, List Management and Call to Invite Campaign.</p>\n<p><em>Database Cleanup</em><br />\nThe Callbox team helped preserve the valuable information in the Client’s<br />\nglobal database which contained millions of key contacts. The team updated and enhanced their existing prospect and customer lists by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reviewing, evaluating and studying the work that needs to be done for the Client’s lists;</li>\n<li>updating addresses, name spellings, titles and email addresses;</li>\n<li>removing or consolidating duplicates;</li>\n<li>normalizing data formats;</li>\n<li>adding key data fields</li>\n<li>phone-verifying all contact and company information</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>List Management</em><br />\nWith the team’s expert knowledge of the direct marketing business and trends in the List Industry, recommendations were given to the Client on how to best utilize their list. After studying the Client’s prospect list, target emails based on interest, demographics, or custom questions were prepared by the Callbox team and sent out using advanced software and systems. Responses and results were recorded, tracked and reported to the Client daily.</p>\n<p><em>Call to Invite Campaign</em><br />\nAfter completing the list cleanup process and list management, Callbox agents went to work calling and qualifying potential attendees as a follow-up on all emails sent. All call activities were automatically logged in to PipelineCRM, Callbox’s customer contact and sales force management system where the Client can view, process or download reports of leads and/or appointments generated by Callbox agents. Personal contact and company information were collected from those who signified their intention to attend the conference, organized and forwarded to the Client to be included in their list of attendees. Highly-trained Callbox agents efficiently multi-tasked, making hundreds of calls daily, identifying potential attendees, providing conference information when requested by prospect and preparing reports for the Client.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>With Callbox providing maximum support prior to their event, the Client was able to focus on preparing for the conference itself and exceeded its target number of attendees. Client was impressed with the Callbox team’s excellent prospecting skills and attention to detail in cleaning up and updating its lists that it renewed its contract several times.</p>\n<p>With Callbox’s list management and efficient reporting, the Client was freed from purging, updating and mailing, as Callbox did everything for them. With enhanced database capabilities, they are exploring an even more extensive direct marketing aimed at solely building their email lists.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_SW_Callbox-Provides-Maximum-Marketing-Support-for-Talent-Management-Solutions-Leader.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_44' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"callbox-provides-maximum-marketing-support-for-talent-management-solutions-leader","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"82c927f6-a866-59fc-b054-37030b26d670"}}
