It has won several major awards and established itself as a leader in market adoption, product innovation, and commitment to the success of its partners.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The Client needed a marketing partner to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Promote its services and drive registrations to its weekly webinars.</li>\n<li>Generate qualified leads to support its in-house sales team.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Generating a minimum of 30 webinar registrations per day required hundreds of calls and became challenging for Client’s in-house staff. Deciding to outsource for the first time, the Client chose Callbox for its extensive experience in B2B telemarketing.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>The Client approved a call-to-invite campaign in June 2010 with a team of eight Callbox telemarketers. Each agent was required to target a quota of four confirmed webinar registrations daily. The Client provided Callbox with a list of potential contacts from various IT organizations. Additionally, Callbox mined its own database of over 20 million records worldwide and segmented thousands of potential registrants in the US and Canada.</p>\n<p>Callbox’s professional telemarketers contacted key decision makers to introduce them to the potential of increased sales and lowered business costs through managed services. Leads that expressed interest and agreed to be contacted by the Client were registered for the webinar and then passed to the Client’s lead development team.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>For almost three years now, Callbox has hit daily and monthly quotas consistently, bringing a total of 35,793 webinar registrations and counting. The success of the US and Canada campaigns inspired the Client to scale up to 20 Callbox agents at one point, and to expand its reach into the UK and New Zealand markets.</p>\n<p><strong>The Testimonials</strong></p>\n<p>“<em>I have been working with the Callbox team for over 12 months. They have acted as our introductory sales team for this period of time. They are a very professional team that responds to all of our needs in a very timely manner. </em></p>\n<p><em>I love the fact that I do not have to deal with sick days or the day to day management of this team anymore. We simply set the objectives, collaborate on the scripting, and then they do their work.</em></p>\n<p><em>I would highly recommend this team.</em>”</p>\n<p>Sean S.<br />\nDirector Partner Development<br />\nJanuary 21, 2011</p>\n<p>“<em>I am pleased to recommend Callbox. They have consistently worked with a collaborative attitude to ensure all processes are current and achieve all set key performance indicators.
