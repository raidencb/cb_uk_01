As one of the most important pieces of legislation on data privacy, the GDPR includes some sweeping rules and requirements that will impact the ways businesses process the personal data of EU individuals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Callbox, we take this opportunity to enhance how we handle our partner’s and customers’ data. We’ve been working to make our data management practices more transparent and more secure, not only to help us prepare for the GDPR, but more importantly to maintain our commitment to the privacy and protection of your data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below, we talk about how the GDPR applies to Callbox and outline the steps we’ve taken to ensure we comply with the new regulation. Please note that the information contained in this resource is provided for informational purposes only and shouldn’t be construed as legal advice.</span></p>\n<h3><b>GDPR Overview</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 25, 2018, the GDPR will finally come into force. The GDPR is a set of laws that greatly improves the protection of personal data for EU citizens and residents, while at the same time increasing the duties and responsibilities of companies that collect and maintain such information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some key highlights:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It gives EU individuals more control over their personal information.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It mandates additional requirements for organizations to protect personal data.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It strengthens the roles and powers of EU data authorities and enhances fines and sanctions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It applies to all organizations that collect and handle the personal information of EU individuals, regardless of where an organization is located.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><b>How the GDPR Affects Callbox</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Callbox has no operations, employees, partners, or contractors in the EU. However, to the extent that Callbox “monitors” EU individuals via the Internet (for example, through their use and access of the Callbox website), we believe the GDPR may apply to us under this condition. This is accordingly where we focus the bulk of our efforts at GDPR compliance.</span></p>\n<h3><b>What we have done to comply</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of May 25 implementation of the GDPR, we’ve carried out a thorough review of our data processing practices and have taken the following steps:</span></p>\n</div></section><br />\n<div class='avia-data-table-wrap avia_responsive_table'><table class='avia-table avia-data-table avia-table-1  '  itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Table\" ><tbody><tr class='avia-heading-row'><th class=''>Requirement</th><th class=''>Description</th><th class=''>Status</th></tr><tr class=''><td class=''>Data Protection Officer (DPO)</td><td class=''>We have designated a DPO to oversee GDPR compliance and carry out the responsibilities described under Article 37.</td><td class=''>Completed</td></tr><tr class=''><td class=''>Security of Processing</td><td class=''>Whatever data we collect and store, we ensure that these are all completely secure and have implemented SSL encryption on all our websites and online services for secure communication.

We have examined the relevant provisions of the GDPR that pertain to the data we keep and we are closely tracking additional applicable GDPR guidance being issued. </span></p>\n<p><b>Steps taken concerning our contact database:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Callbox has appointed a Data Protection Officer assigned the task of securing data and compliance with the GDPR guidelines.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Callbox has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate required by the GDPR.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since our target markets are North America and the Asia-Pacific, Callbox is not actively collecting any personal data on EU-member country residents. This is our assurance to clients that any data we provide them will not expose them to any risk of any GDPR penalties. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further guarantee compliance, we have searched our records for possible EU-member residents on our contact database based on the country they are in and we have removed their personal information which mainly consisted only of their company email address. Although these are company-assigned email addresses, they contained first and last name data which directly pointed to a specific data subject.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unique client-supplied data will only be used for that specific client’s campaign and is afterward removed from Callbox’s database after the campaign. Callbox will require assurance from the Client that any data turned over to Callbox is GDPR compliant.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div></section></p></div><div class=\"flex_column av_one_fifth   \"></div></p>\n","slug":"gdpr","date":"May 29, 2018"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"56ae4b28-c5c5-53c5-b89d-0ad99b8cb5f6"}}
