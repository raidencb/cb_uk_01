Since 1995, the Client has served over <a title=\"Clients\" href=\"http://www.tenrox.com/en/about/clientmap.htm\" target=\"_blank\">800 organizations around the world</a>, including Caterpillar, Corning Cable Systems RD&amp;E division, First National Bank, Hydro Quebec – DPE, Invensys Systems Canada, Major Drilling, Pioneer Natural Resources, State of Wyoming, The Pentagon, University of Michigan, Fisher Scientific, and Wyeth Biopharma.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>With the volume of traffic the Client’s website gets every day, the Client needed to gather significant information from all its visitors in order to enhance its service offerings. It sought the services of a sales and marketing expert to handle all website inquiries and calls on their behalf and more importantly, qualify visitors and identify their needs so that its sales team can focus more on closing deals.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>For Client’s needs, Callbox implemented an extremely effective marketing strategy — Lead Qualification.</p>\n<p>The Callbox team handled all service inquiries in the Client’s website. Callbox agents profiled the Client’s visitors by asking them their role in the company they represent, what industry they belonged to, the motivation behind visiting the website and gathering their contact information. The more crucial process was finding out what service they were interested in and what their requirements were. The qualifying process included questions on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Budget</li>\n<li>Current processes and software solutions</li>\n<li>Number of Users</li>\n<li>Target implementation date</li>\n<li>Industry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While discussing these criteria and requirements, each Callbox Lead Manager types notes directly into Thunderchild using the template of the question and determines which among his or her list should be given a follow up call.</p>\n<p>Once a lead is set to qualified, the Callbox sales team will then take over. An appropriate sales representative is assigned to a particular set of prospects based on their geographic location as well as the size and scope of the implementation. The sales representative then calls these prospects for a more thorough discussion about their business requirements in preparation for an eventual product demonstration.</p>\n<p>Owing to the Callbox team’s excellent communication skills, consistency and efficiency in the conduct of the Lead Qualification campaign, the Client has been getting a steady flow of qualified appointments. Its sales team is now devoting full attention to closing deals, significantly increasing sales.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_SW_Callbox-Delivers-Qualified-Leads-for-Workforce-Management-Solutions-Expert.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_42' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"callbox-delivers-qualified-leads-for-workforce-management-solutions-expert","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"98a93517-abb7-5894-8205-79d08e114730"}}
