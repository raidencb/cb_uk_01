They provide a complete service continuum of Oracle, PeopleSoft, JD Edwards and SQL Server including: sales, planning, design, implementation, project management and support. Their offices are based in Australia and New Zealand and their support centre services a large diverse client-base located across five countries.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenges</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increase sales and generate awareness about the benefits of the Client’s products and services</li>\n<li>Promote the Client’s event entitled “Oracle Leadership Forum”, gather attendees and confirm their attendance</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>Callbox launched two campaigns â€“ Lead Generation through Telemarketing, and a Call-to-Invite Campaign.</p>\n<p><em>Lead Generation Campaign</em><br />\nCallbox agents made calls to CIOs of companies from a list of prospects provided by the Client. Every call began with the introduction of the Client’s company, followed by an invitation to an introductory chat about the benefits of the Client’s support services with the Client’s Business Development Manager. Once a positive response was received, Callbox callers emailed information about the Client’s services and collected the prospect’s mobile number and preferred time of meeting. This information was entered into PipelineCRM, Callbox’s customer relationship management system, for the Client to review and follow-up.</p>\n<p><em>Call-to-Invite Campaign</em><br />\nThe Client had previously sent email invitations to a list of prospects for the Oracle Leadership Forum. The Callbox Team’s task was to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call those prospects and confirm receipt of the invite from the Client</li>\n<li>Confirm attendance to the leadership forum</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Callbox callers collected contact information from prospects who signified their intention to attend the free leadership forum. They collected the attendees’ names, company names and email addresses for the Client’s registration files. Prospects who informed Callbox that they failed to receive invites to the event were sent invitations through email and received a confirmation call 48 hours later.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>Both campaigns were executed quickly and immediately, giving the Client enough warm leads to follow-up right away, and a good number of attendees to their event.</p>\n<p>The Client especially enjoyed working with the Callbox team, citing the team’s excellent communications skills and efficiency. The Client was also pleased with the convenience and flexibility of lead tracking and management with the use of Callbox’s PipelineCRM. Having received good quality leads following a successful company event, the Client plans to use Callbox’s services for future lead generation campaigns as well as promotional and invitational campaigns for company-sponsored events.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_SW_Rock-Solid-Leads-for-AU-and-NZ%E2%80%99s-Top-Technology-Consulting-Firm.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_48' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"rock-solid-leads-for-au-and-nzs-top-technology-consulting-firm","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"3d57daa0-66f4-545f-83e8-858ad02962fe"}}
