Dish Network offers a variety of HD programming such as theater-quality movie channels, educational and nature programming, Pay-Per-View HD movies, and HD broadcasts of special events, including concerts, boxing matches and professional sporting events.</p>\n<p>The Client offers TV and entertainment packages that are put together to give choice and value, loaded with popular options for a low price as well as very affordable equipment upgrades.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenges</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Growth</li>\n<li>Existing competition</li>\n<li>Insufficient in-house support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Providing satellite sales, installation and service throughout the US was not easy for the Client which was a young company. It saw the need to grow, not only in terms of client base but in customer service capacity as well, in line with its goal to provide outstanding service to its customers. The Client faced stiff competition from huge cable providers all over the US so it needed a major marketing campaign to introduce its company, its offers and retain a loyal set of customers. An attempt at in-house sales operations was made by the client, but did not generate as many customers as expected. The Client saw the need for a partner to reach its target market and eventually, hit its sales target.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>In order to gather interest for the Client, Callbox launched a Lead Generation campaign in April 2006. Since the Client had in-house specialists, the task of Callbox agents was limited to gathering prospects by generating interest in the Client’s offers, and forwarding these prospects to specialists who closed the sales. A total of 10 agents consisting of 7 openers and 3 closers handled Client’s account. The 6-month lead generation campaign by Callbox customer representatives involved the introduction of the company, its offers and basic installation information.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>After a 6-month lead generation campaign and 2 months of pre-close transfers, the Client requested Callbox agents to close deals as well, a significant show of confidence in Callbox agents. The Client was able to cut costs by reducing in-house sales support and rely solely on telemarketing in order to sign and maintain customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Growth. At the start of the campaign, the Client’s target market was limited to Southern California. Its client base has spread over 13 states, including Texas, Arizona and Oregon. The Client achieved a hefty 50% increase in installations per day.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>In a display of satisfaction with the results of the Callbox campaign and as a result of the good relations between Callbox and the Client, its Sales Director scheduled a week-long visit to the dedicated team, and performed in-depth sales training at the Callbox on-site training facilities. The training focused on sales techniques for both sales coaches and agents. The principles learned were shared across all applicable Callbox teams.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the Client’s first experience with outsourcing, and Callbox is proud to be chosen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_OTH_Callbox-Dishes-Out-The-Leads.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_173' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-24686'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"callbox-dishes-out-the-leads","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2281d8b4-d2dd-57e6-a847-dddad92c35f2"}}
