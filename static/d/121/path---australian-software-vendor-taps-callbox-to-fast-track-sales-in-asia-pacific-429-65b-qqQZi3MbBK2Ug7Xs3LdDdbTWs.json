Its clients include Ingram Micro, The University of Sydney, Accenture, CitiStreet, and Acumen Alliance.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The Client has excellent brand recognition in Australia and its products have strong market potential. However, it had difficulty penetrating foreign markets often dominated by large global competitors. The Client did not invest significantly in marketing aside from the irregular cold calling efforts by its sales staff.  The primary source of new clients was word of mouth.</p>\n<p>To boost its capability to compete squarely in the international market, the Client looked for an appointment setting company to carry out its objectives methodically:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To educate prospects on the benefits of practice management software</li>\n<li>To schedule product demos with interested prospects</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This campaign required technically sound telemarketers with firsthand experience in selling software systems. Having campaigned on behalf of several IT and software companies for many years, Callbox was qualified for the challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>Following a campaign brief, Callbox set up an outbound telemarketing team. The Client specified potential customers: IT Directors, CIOs, Managers, and C-level Executives. Callbox prepared a customized telemarketing list and created personalized scripts based on typical market response and various selling scenarios.</p>\n<p>Callbox implemented stringent QA monitoring to ensure that every lead and appointment generation effort supported the Client’s requirements. Callbox encouraged the Client’s active participation in each campaign process – from script development to new product trainings and lead qualification. This allowed to Client to provide inputs and feedback as the campaign progressed.</p>\n<p>Callbox maintained an impressive momentum throughout the 18-month calling campaign, contacting 4,887 companies at an average of 222 calls per day. The Client witnessed the action in real-time via Callbox’s Pipeline CRM, which also allowed it to respond promptly to appointments and other actionable results.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Out of 88,000 calls, 17% resulted in positive contacts. Of those spoken to, 31% agreed to a demo and 28% requested additional info.</li>\n<li>Callbox delivered a total of 357 qualified appointments at an average of one appointment per day. From that, 44 (12.3%) resulted in sales.</li>\n<li>Simply put, the Client got a sale for every 2000 calls made by Callbox; about 2.5 sales per month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Greatly impressed by its performance, the Client continues to rely on Callbox for its outbound marketing campaigns, as it continues to grow its market share, not only in Australia, but now in the expanded markets of New Zealand, Brunei, and India. It also intends to hire additional agents to keep up with the influx of new leads and further increase its marketing activities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_SW_Australian-Software-Vendor-Taps-Callbox-to-Fast-track-Sales-in-Asia-Pacific.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_56' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"australian-software-vendor-taps-callbox-to-fast-track-sales-in-asia-pacific","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"9e80053b-e04d-5579-90f3-6380d658e1f4"}}
