They specialize in the Sage Software family of products – Sage MAS 90 and 200, Sage BusinessWorks, Sage CRM, and JobOps Job management software. The Client helps businesses increase productivity and profitability through the application of integrated accounting, distribution and management software. Their reporting tools allow users to quickly and easily extract, analyze and professionally present business information.</p>\n<p>The Client’s services include software selection, system design and implementation, user training and support, data conversion, and eCommerce/EDI/CRM consulting. With the goal of being the most trusted and most responsive in the network technology and business management industry, they have helped over 400 companies in a wide variety of industries. The Client engaged the services of Callbox in August 2005</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Considering the stiff competition and difficulty of marketing business software, it was crucial for the Client to double, even triple their sales and marketing efforts in order to find prospects. They lacked the team and resources to search for prospects. Sales and marketing was handled by one person who wanted to focus on presenting proposals and closing deals and could not be burdened by the time-consuming search for prospects. The Client needed to scour the market for businesses with upcoming software system projects such as software evaluation and upgrading. They targeted businesses that needed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>system change</li>\n<li>system upgrade or downgrade</li>\n<li>system maintenance</li>\n<li>add-ons to current system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Client sought a partner to find these prospects, generate interest for the products and services and provide all necessary marketing support to achieve their goal.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>The Client turned to Callbox to rev up their sales efforts.</p>\n<p>Callbox initially carried out an invitational campaign in Aug. 2005, calling prospects and inviting them to attend meetings and/or seminars conducted by the Client. A series of lead generation and appointment setting campaigns followed, spread out over a year, alternately conducted on a per-lead or per-seat arrangement. Since the start of the campaign, the call quota of Callbox agents rose from 100 to 160 calls per day, targeting 20 leads per month as required by the Client.</p>\n<p>Callbox agents inquired about prospects’ plans to change or replace their business management software in the next 3-12 months. This was followed by a series of questions regarding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>satisfaction with the current software being used</li>\n<li>flaws/problems with current software</li>\n<li>current systems used for operation and accounting</li>\n<li>evidence of manual or double entry for processes</li>\n<li>interest in changing or upgrading current software</li>\n<li>functionalities expected from the software</li>\n<li>time-frame for implementation</li>\n<li>budget</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from calling prospects, the Callbox team sent out brochures to customers asking for additional information. Prospects that had talked with the Client’s sales consultant were also forwarded to Callbox agents for follow-up calls.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>Since August 2005, Callbox agents placed a total of 27,857 calls for the Client, and have forwarded 240 leads since the start of the lead generation and appointment setting campaigns. With Callbox handling the qualification and forwarding of hot leads, the Client now devotes full attention to closing deals significantly increasing sales. They were pleased with the performance of the Callbox team who delivered a total of 72 leads from February to June 2007. Thereafter, the Client pre-extended their contract through to September 2007.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_SW_Callbox-and-Software-Leader-Spell-Success.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_40' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"callbox-and-software-leader-spell-success","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c2bca475-a4e2-5974-984d-196df484a5fb"}}
