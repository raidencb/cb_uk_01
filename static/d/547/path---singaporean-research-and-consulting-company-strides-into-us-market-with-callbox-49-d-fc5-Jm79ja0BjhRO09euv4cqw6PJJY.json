It has worked with over 50 Global Fortune 1000 companies in solving market growth and entry problems, and has supported export promotion, Foreign Direct Investment attraction, and policy formulation programs of various government agencies in 15 countries.</p>\n<p>Its high profile clients include Honda, Philips, Kohler, Yamaha Motors, Tupperware, Schneider Electric, and the Malaysian Rubber Export Promotion Council.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The Client, based in Singapore, wanted to expand its operations into the US to capture contracts with larger companies. However, it lacked resources to penetrate the vast American market. Its primary source of new businesses was word of mouth and referrals from existing clients.</p>\n<p>The Client wanted direct communication opportunities with decision makers of larger prospects and decided to partner with Callbox to design an outbound telemarketing campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>The Client’s outbound telemarketing campaign targeted C-level Executives and Research Development Directors. The contact team guaranteed five face-to-face appointments with Fortune 1000 prospects. Callbox customized the campaign script, highlighting the Client’s major customers worldwide in order to underscore credibility, add value, and get a higher response rate.</p>\n<p>The calling list would be the most important factor of the campaign. Callbox factored a custom list of Fortune 1000 companies and went on to profile each one to identify decision makers. As a result, the call flow was quick, smooth, and precise.</p>\n<p>Given the campaign’s geographic location, meeting with prospects required advance preparation on the part of the Client. To address related circumstances, Callbox booked all appointments at least a month in advance to give the Client ample time to make necessary preparations. Where possible, several appointments were scheduled sequentially on the same day, or on consecutive days. Callbox saw to it that all appointments were stringently qualified and confirmed to avoid “no-shows” and ensure clockwork meetings.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>As guaranteed, Callbox delivered five face-to-face appointments with Fortune 1000 clients in one month, all scheduled on two consecutive dates. Most impressive was the fact that the Client was able to close all five of them, which speaks to the effectiveness of its sales team, the effectiveness of the partnership, and quality of Callbox’s appointment setting service.</p>\n<p>Because of this achievement, the Client re-hired Callbox to conduct an appointment setting campaign in Europe and APAC which was equally successful. Callbox is currently running a telemarketing campaign for the Client in Singapore.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_OTH_Singaporean-Research-and-Consulting-Company-Strides-into-US-Market-with-Callbox.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_177' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-24686'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"singaporean-research-and-consulting-company-strides-into-us-market-with-callbox","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"251a6140-fb34-5cfe-a730-9f04447bf262"}}
