For more than 50 years now, the business holds the reputation in quality that has been built on strict, on-time delivery, and accurate professional transcription for events, meetings, interviews, arbitrations and courts throughout the country.</p>\n<p><b>Product &amp; Service Offered</b></p>\n<p>For the leadoff campaign, the focus was to set appointments with specific decision makers for specific industries. In those meetings, Client introduced and discussed the feature and benefits of VIQ Solutions &#8211; the world’s leading expert in digital audio, video and evidence capture and management solutions.</p>\n<p><em>VIQ Solutions</em> provides digital recording applications that allow multiple channels of audio and video recordings to be recorded simultaneously with annotations and other information attached to it.</p>\n<p><b>The Challenge</b></p>\n<p>The project plan to partner with a lead generation company was brought about by the Client’s challenge to be able to get through arduous targets like Legal, Medical &amp; Investigation. These are industries that require detailed transcription/dictation tasks as they deal with sensitive and delicate matters.</p>\n<div>\n<p><b>The Callbox Solution</b></p>\n<p>The Client signed Callbox for a campaign of 10 phone appointments qualified against its “ideal customer” standards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A full-package, multi-channel marketing program was provided by the Callbox team.:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">An agent who called for the campaign for 8 hours everyday.</span><br />\nDespite the agent starting out with with limited knowledge on transcription services, through the Callbox leader’s orientation and training, as well as the agent’s interest to learn the mechanics and myriad of applications of such a service , the agent achieved the Client’s desired level of proficiency in speaking with prospects about VIQ Solutions.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">A well-filtered database.</span><br />\nFiltering a database for the Client’s required target industries was quite a challenge for the Callbox team, as the number of these type of organizations in a country or region is quite below standards, as compared with consumer-centric businesses. But the team still managed to work well with the approved database.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Client-approved calling script.</span><br />\nThe calling script served as a guide for the caller to keep himself aligned and knowledgeably-sounding in offering the product &amp; services’ value proposition, and setting solid appointments with target decision makers.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">LinkedIn Account</span><br />\nThe Callbox team built and managed the LinkedIn account, which was approved and kept monitored by the Client at which conversation threads with connections were viewed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Emails</span><br />\nEmail templates were drafted by Callbox and were approved by the Client. The templates varied in approach depending on the call disposal set by the agent on each call.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Campaign Status Reports</span><br />\nThe weekly reports sent to the Client discussed about statistics and feedback about the campaign. Challenges encountered by the caller in his calls were noted, and corresponding action plans were suggested and implemented for each.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Calendar Invite</span><br />\nA calendar invite was utilized to confirm set appointments with interested prospects. And if by chance, that a prospect declined the calendar invite, the Callbox team worked out a follow up call for a reschedule, and made sure that no appointment/lead is lost.</p>\n</div>\n<p><b>The Results</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Callbox was able to open the doors for more opportunities for the Client to reach quite elusive targets in the tribunals and local councils in Australia by adding 9 solid leads to their existing client list.</li>\n<li>Client signed for another contract, which was for another company under his management and which offered enterprise audio and text management products and systems.</li>\n<li>Client is currently nurturing all the leads and maintained communications with Callbox for possible campaigns early this year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Callbox opened more doors of opportunities for the Client by complementing its business objectives with a multi-channel marketing scheme.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_OTH_Spark-and-Cannon.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_37' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-24686'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"callbox-takes-on-challenge-and-scores-a-viqtory","date":"January 15, 2016"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"483c230d-e594-514e-8215-a44d99bff631"}}
