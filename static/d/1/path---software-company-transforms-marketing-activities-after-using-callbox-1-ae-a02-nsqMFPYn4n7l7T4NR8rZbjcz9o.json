Based in Singapore, it has more than 100 employees serving over 200 clients worldwide. Its IT solutions are being used by well-known customers around the world, mostly shipping companies, liner agents, short sea carriers, NVOCCs, terminals, and depots.</p>\n<p><strong>The Objective</strong></p>\n<p>The Client wanted to increase sales from new businesses and open new markets abroad. Although it had its own inside sales team running its lead generation campaigns, the Client found managing international campaigns quite challenging given the scope of its target market which required working in different time zones. So, it looked for a marketing partner who could execute a more targeted lead generation campaign and bring in more qualified sales leads for its inside sales team to focus on.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Upon learning about Callbox in 2007, the Client was hesitant because outsourced telemarketing service was embryonic and unproven in Singapore at the time. Nevertheless, by explaining the benefits of outsourcing to a qualified telemarketing company, Callbox was able to convince the Client to embark on a cold calling campaign with them.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>The first campaign took off in February 2007 with one dedicated telemarketing agent. Close coordination between the Client and the Callbox Team played an important role throughout this campaign. Callbox conducted weekly conference calls with the Client to address campaign-related issues and facilitate exchange of ideas. The Client also provided Callbox with weekly updates on companies they wanted to focus on. The success of this campaign was a result of both parties’ willingness to work closely together in addressing questions and concerns.</p>\n<p>The Client expressed why it continued to use Callbox’s services after the first campaign::</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Callbox did an excellent job in generating interest in the Client’s target market.</li>\n<li>Callbox was able to bring in new clients despite working across different cultures and time zones.</li>\n<li>Callbox managed to keep regular communication with the Client.</li>\n<li>Callbox agents possessed the ability to grasp information fast.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong>The Client was one of Callbox’s first accounts in the Asia-Pacific region, and it has continued to use its services since the first campaign in 2007. The Client also used Callbox in other projects including a call-to-invite campaign targeting Dubai and UAE, lead generation in Europe, SEO, and market research.</p>\n<p>Extremely satisfied with results from these campaigns, the Client recommended Callbox to its sister company, an established aviation software solutions provider. The Client also referred three more accounts who became regular Callbox customers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_SW_Software-Company-Transforms-Marketing-Activities-after-Using-Callbox.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_58' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"software-company-transforms-marketing-activities-after-using-callbox","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"e345bd0f-1787-5807-b6e8-ae62da951749"}}
