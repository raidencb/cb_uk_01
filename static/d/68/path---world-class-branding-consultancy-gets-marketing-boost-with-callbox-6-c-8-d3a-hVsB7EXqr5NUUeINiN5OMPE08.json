Over the past 40 years, it has created and managed branding campaigns for some of the world’s most recognized brands including BMW, P&amp;G, and McDonalds.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Part of the Client’s marketing strategy is conducting a series of events each year. One of those events was a free seminar workshop held in Singapore and Thailand, aimed at introducing its branding solutions to potential customers. To maximize the marketing value of this event, the Client looked for a marketing partner who could develop an effort that combined email and telemarketing to generate its desired number of registrations in a short span of time. The Client’s objective was two-fold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To identify target contacts and send out email invites.</li>\n<li>To qualify prospects based on the Client’s pre-defined criteria.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>Having worked with a number of big companies in Singapore and Thailand before, the Client had already compiled a database contacts which would be used in this campaign. The overall effort started in September 04, 2013 and involved two waves of marketing activity leading to the event.</p>\n<p>The first was an email campaign to send out invitations containing details of the event, along with a short summary of the Client‘s profile and its services. Target contacts included C-level decision makers from the top 200 local companies in Singapore and Thailand.</p>\n<p>The second wave involved an outbound telemarketing outreach to qualify email respondents based on the Client’s qualification criteria. Qualified respondents were then forwarded to the Client’s team for confirmation and event registration. Callbox submitted weekly RSVP reports which allowed the Client to forecast the number of potential attendees and make adjustments to step up the campaign when necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>Both campaigns were successful not only in terms of quantity (number of leads generated), but more importantly, in quality. The email blast generated an impressive response rate that a week prior to the campaign’s completion, the Client contracted another agent from Callbox to assist with the calls. In 22 days, the campaign generated a total of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>39 qualified leads</li>\n<li>30 confirmed RSVPs (a whopping 76% RSVP rate)</li>\n</ul>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_18' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"world-class-branding-consultancy-gets-marketing-boost-with-callbox","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"4d003140-18ed-5269-ba79-188e31950687"}}
