The slacken number of new customers in the database urged the Client to decide on taking new marketing options that can help them cope with the problem. A lead generation program was plotted to carry out the Client’s goal <i>to acquire new and more customers.</i></p>\n<p><b>The Callbox Solution</b></p>\n<p>Callbox’s Multi-Touch Multi-Channel Lead Generation Program was strategically designed to help clients get in front of their customers at the best time when they are most ready to listen and are most interested. This was made possible by Callbox for the Client through the Pipeline Lead Nurture Tool.</p>\n<p>In the campaign, the Client aimed to promote its core services: Workforce Analytics, Human Resource Consulting and Workforce Strategy and Optimisation. These services were common among HR Consultancy providers in the region but the Client wanted to make a difference in addressing the customer&#8217;s’ HR requirements by doing a top-to-toe solution.</p>\n<p>Initial Email Copies</p>\n<p>Using the Pipeline Lead Nurture Tool, the Callbox team sent out initial email copies bearing the Client’s summary of services and solutions, website and query boxes. Email replies and actions taken by prospects such as clicking the website and queries were tracked in real time for the agent to follow-up on.</p>\n<p>Appointment Setting</p>\n<p>Follow-up calls were made by the Callbox agent wherein probing questions were asked to discover the prospects’ HR needs and so that the Client may be able to tailor fit the best services and solutions for them. The key questions focused on monies invested in the people aspects and the quality of the organization’s human capital initiatives. The prospects’ answers were carefully and properly noted and all contact details were verified before the calls were disposed.</p>\n<p>Request For More Information</p>\n<p>Prospects who requested for more information were as good as completed leads. Brochures were set by the Client himself for the purpose of analyzing the prospect’s business status and to come up with the best answer to their questions.</p>\n<p><b>The Results</b></p>\n<p>The campaign delivered a total of <b>15 solid appointments</b>, <b>63 warm follow ups</b> and <b>228 RFIs</b> (request for information). The 15 appointments set by the Callbox team were companies that had varied HR needs specifically on workforce planning, management and reporting.</p>\n<p>With the Callbox Multi-Touch Multi-Channel Marketing Program and the Pipeline Lead Nurture Tool, the Client was able achieve its goal to <b>acquire new customers</b>. Moreso, they look forward to acquiring more new customers from their list of warm follow-ups that they currently nurture.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_OTH_Callbox-Breeds-New-Customers-For-HR-Consultancy-Leader.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_8' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-24686'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"callbox-breeds-new-customers-for-hr-consultancy-leader","date":"November 10, 2016"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"45cb9761-1eb1-535e-9794-88a340339357"}}
