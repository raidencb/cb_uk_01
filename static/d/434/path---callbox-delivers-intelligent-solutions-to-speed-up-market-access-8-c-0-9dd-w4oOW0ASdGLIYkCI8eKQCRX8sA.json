Its online business solutions include web design and applications development, internet marketing, project consulting, e-commerce, and interactive development.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Over the years, the Client was performing well with its own sales team dialing for prospects and closing sales. Though their services were known to be superior in the industry, and repeat business was substantial, they found that they had to devote too much of their limited time to prospecting for leads. The Client needed to find a more productive way of generating business leads and face-to-face appointments without consuming the time allotted for presenting product demos and closing sales.</p>\n<p>The Client had the following specific objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To speed up market penetration</li>\n<li>To ensure an ongoing flow of leads into their pipeline</li>\n<li>To increase their lead-to-sale conversion ratio</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After thorough planning and consultation, the Client decided to experiment with outsourcing for the first time, and chose Callbox as a strategic enterprise partner.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>The Client came to Callbox to develop and launch an initial three-month cold calling campaign as a pilot project to see if they could produce a sufficient number of leads to increase sales. The campaign began with a thirty-minute coaching session conducted by the Client and attended by a Callbox agent, team leader, and an account manager. Callbox’s broad experience in lead generation and appointment setting for all types of internet business solutions allowed the team to quickly recognize the particular needs of this client’s campaign.</p>\n<p>Callbox used the script provided by the Client to create various sets of customized proposition messages to best fit the various industry sectors targeted in the campaign. This made the campaign largely unscripted but more personal and highly effective to each target sector. Callbox capitalized mostly on its own contacts database to identify potential prospects and increase the number of contacts of senior level targets.</p>\n<p>The first campaign was launched in April 2010. Every Thursday, the Client was provided with weekly activity reports on pipeline and lead activity, appointment dates, and the overall campaign status.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>The campaign was successful and extended the three-month pilot project into a nine-month rolling deal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A total of 139 leads and 103 appointments was generated as of October 2010.</li>\n<li>Callbox averaged 185 calls and 162 contacts per day, achieving a stunning contact rate of 87.8% (18,330 contacts out of 20,859 calls).</li>\n<li>The Client reported four sales and dozens of warm proposals in October 2010 alone.</li>\n<li>A total of 424 contacts expressed specific interest and requested future callbacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Client is set to recontract in January to formulate its plans for 2011.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_IT_Callbox-Delivers-Intelligent-Solutions-to-Speed-Up-Market-Access.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_28' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"callbox-delivers-intelligent-solutions-to-speed-up-market-access","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"ba42aabe-ae4c-52d9-8ef2-3d306845151f"}}
