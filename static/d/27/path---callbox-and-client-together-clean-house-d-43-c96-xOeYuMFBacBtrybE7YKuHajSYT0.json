It has nearly 40,000 customers worldwide, providing services with state-of-the-art equipment and the most efficient chemicals available. The Client applies superior cleaning techniques with one goal in mind: to revolutionize the commercial cleaning industry. Its extraordinary growth is attributed to its system-wide network of over 90 Support Centers in the United States, Australia, Asia, Canada and South America, with plans for further expansion.</p>\n<p>The Client specializes in hard floor care, carpet cleaning, window cleaning, pressure washing, and restroom sanitation and was ranked by Inc. Magazine in its prestigious Inc. 500 issue as one of the 500 fastest growing privately held companies in the United States. The Client continuously strives to develop new and innovative cleaning solutions to enhance the work environments of its customers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Due to its huge client base, the Client knew the time was right to further expand its territory. The Client wanted to continuously search for other businesses to which it could offer its services in line with its plans for further expansion. The Client needed a partner to increase its flexibility to cover a larger area. The three requirements were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the prospect property be at least 1,500 square feet;</li>\n<li>it needed cleaning service at least once a week; and</li>\n<li>that hotels, restaurants and government offices be excluded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Client’s marketing arm needed to focus on closing deals, instead of spending a considerable amount of time researching industries and facilities that needed their services.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>For the Client’s needs, Callbox chose the most appropriate marketing tool — Appointment Setting.</p>\n<p>An Appointment Setting Campaign was launched in June 2006. Two full-time callers targeted commercial and industrial offices found in San Francisco and Los Angeles, with the exception of hotels, restaurants and government offices.</p>\n<p>Since each appointment setting campaign is unique, Callbox assigns telemarketers that are best suited for individual programs. After discussing the strategic process with the Client, qualified meetings with specifically targeted and properly identified decision-makers were set up.</p>\n<p>Some of the information Callbox agents were tasked to collect and confirm are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Company and property sizes</li>\n<li>Number of employees</li>\n<li>Frequency of cleaning needed</li>\n<li>Estimated number of people who visit the office everyday</li>\n<li>Satisfaction with current cleaning services company</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Setting and confirmation of qualified appointments immediately followed after agents successfully generated interest in the Client’s cleaning services.</p>\n<p>A more thorough presentation of the Client’s full range of services, their customized service proposal, and details of the cleaning schedule and specific areas to be serviced were left to the Client’s marketing arm.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>Due to Callbox representatives’ excellent communication skills and persistence in the conduct of the appointment setting campaign, the Client expressed satisfaction with Callbox’s services and since then has a steady flow of qualified appointments for its sales team.</p>\n<p>As of July 2007, Client has renewed its contract ten consecutive times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_CC_Callbox-and-Client-Together-Clean-House.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_8' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"callbox-and-client-together-clean-house","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2d6b3183-3238-5de8-9898-77e3ddb8ab79"}}
