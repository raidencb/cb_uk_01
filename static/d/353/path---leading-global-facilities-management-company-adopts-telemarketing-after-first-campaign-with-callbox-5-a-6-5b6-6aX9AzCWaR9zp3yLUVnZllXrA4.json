It provides integrated facilities management services including mechanical, electrical, fire service, hydraulic, janitorial services, landscaping, and pest control.</p>\n<p>As of 2014, the Client’s main company operates in six countries including the US, Canada, Australia, South Korea, India, and China, servicing over 300 million square feet of municipalities, schools, stadiums, offices, and various industrial and non-industrial facilities.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>For many years, the Client had been relying on occasional email and inbound marketing efforts to generate sales opportunities. Despite its impressive portfolio of services, it often struggled to produce a sufficient number of sales leads to reach its production targets.</p>\n<p>So, when the opportunity came up to evaluate other options for future growth, the Client knew their lead generation strategy had to change. Soon, it saw the potential in telemarketing. However, since it did not have the right toolset to implement a targeted cold calling campaign, it decided to take the outsourcing route for the first time, and ultimately chose Callbox.</p>\n<p>The Client outlined its objectives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To identify potential customers within its target market</li>\n<li>To conduct a targeted telemarketing campaign to generate leads for its in-house sales team</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>As per the Client’s requirement, Callbox focused on contacts within 60 kilometers of the central business districts of Dandenong and Melbourne in Victoria, and of Elizabeth in Southern Australia. The campaign specifically targeted commercial buildings, warehouses, and industrial facilities with a total floor area of at least 30,000 square meters.</p>\n<p>Given the scope of its target market, Callbox immediately recognized the challenge of launching a targeted telemarketing campaign. It started off with an email blast, and utilized its in-house research team to manually profile, filter, segment, and qualify prospects against the Client’s criteria. Despite the staggering amount of work it required, Callbox was able to round-up its resources and get the calling campaign running in no time.</p>\n<p>Finding decision makers proved to be a real challenge, particularly with rented facilities. In this situation, there was simply no substitute for experience, and Callbox’s 10 years of expertise in telemarketing truly played out.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>After the initial campaign, Callbox delivered three qualified sales leads which the Client followed up promptly. The Client re-contracted for a three-month telemarketing campaign yielding a total of 17 additional prospects, increasing the number of qualified sales leads to 20.</p>\n<p>Pleased with the results, the Client endorsed Callbox to its mother company in the US, and hired another salesperson to keep up with the influx of new business opportunities.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_CC_Callbox-Cleans-Up-Expansion-Clutter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_12' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"leading-global-facilities-management-company-adopts-telemarketing-after-first-campaign-with-callbox","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2179b233-9a02-59e7-bb4a-a35a3055c5c2"}}
