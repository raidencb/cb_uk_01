However, this market dominion was somewhat threatened when payroll system providers in New Zealand offered the same or similar packages on software functionalities like Auditing, Templates, Tracking Capabilities, Costing Statistics, Pay History, Contributions and Help Desk Support, which deflated the Client’s huge number of customer database by 20%.</p>\n<p>The competitors were seen to be quite aggressive in generating more customers, so the Client decided to combat the move by undertaking feisty initiatives like outsourcing a lead generation company who would help them <i>look for new customers and win back those they’ve lost. </i></p>\n<p><b>The Callbox Solution</b></p>\n<p>Callbox’s multi-channel marketing program was designed to help clients maximize the full potential of a well-profiled and managed database to get them in front of their target prospects with the right message, at the right time.</p>\n<p>In the said campaign, the Client required the Callbox team to <i>generate leads using two different approaches for lost customers and new targets. The generated leads were differentiated into two categories, </i>and from which the Client customized their solution/offers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prospects (new targets) who agreed to speak with the Client’s representative to discuss about the product /solution and its benefits</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Approach:</p>\n<p>This type of target customers were sent initial email copies that contained FAQs about their pain points like Holiday Pays, Leave Rates calculations, etc. As soon as the prospect opened the email or took action like clicked the Client’s website or accessed any link in the email, which were tracked real-time by the Callbox team, the contact was then scheduled in the Callbox PIpeline to be called by the agent and set for an office, online demo or phone appointment with the Client’s specialists.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lost customers who agreed to speak again with the Client’s specialists and were interested to know about new offers</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Approach:</p>\n<p>For winback customers, the initial email copies included cost- and time-saving offers from the Client such as systems upgrade at the same package cost, restructured payment schemes and a sample comparative script of how their old service would look like upon return. A day after the initial copies were sent out, whether or not the prospect had opened or taken any action on the email or not, the agent made follow-up calls to those targets and set them for office, online demo or phone appointments with the Client’s specialists.</p>\n<p>In addition, the agent incorporated a customer profiling activity during follow-up calls which made the database more accurate by updating contact information like the decision maker’s name, company name and address, contact numbers, email addresses and social media accounts.</p>\n<p><b>The Results</b></p>\n<p>The Callbox team generated a total of 84 Leads: 11 Office and 35 Phone Appointments and 38 Online Demonstration Bookings which were all part of the 2,343 Positive Contacts that included warm follow-ups. Out of the 84 Leads, 38 (40%) were winback customers.</p>\n<p><b>Callbox’s multi-channel marketing platform was effectively utilized for the payroll leader’s lead generation campaign and which realized their goals to win back lost customers and acquire new ones worth nurturing.</b></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_IT_HR-Market-Leader-Wins-It-All-Back-and-More-with-Callbox.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_12' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-24686'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"hr-market-leader-wins-it-all-back-and-more-with-callbox","date":"October 25, 2016"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"350fe8fd-4c9f-59db-95d8-521a68236f52"}}
