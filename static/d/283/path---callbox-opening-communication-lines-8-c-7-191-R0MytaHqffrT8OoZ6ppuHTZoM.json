Their services include the design and installation of structured cabling, equipment installation and maintenance, and voice and data networking, including LANs, WANs, routers, hubs, switches, firewalls, and high-speed internet access. Their expertise includes designing and installing cabling for everything from small offices to large, multiple site locations.</p>\n<p>Business is headquartered in Lemont Illinois with branch offices in Santa Fe Springs and Sacramento in California. They provide IP-PBX systems, IP-enabled Systems, VoIP Phone Systems, VoIP solutions, VoIP Technology and traditional TDM systems. For carrier-based services, they offer T-1, ISDN-PRI T1, dedicated internet access, integrated voice and data T-1′s, DSL, and more. The Client strives to be a single-source solution for companies’ telephone, video, and data communication needs. The Client engaged the services of Callbox in September 2006.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The Client’s objective was to see an increase in the number of its sales leads so that it could service more customers in the areas where its facilities were located. The Client has its own sales representatives for each county but they felt they needed supplemental support in searching for leads and wanted these leads forwarded to their in-house sales representatives for follow-up.</p>\n<p>The Client searched for an outsourcing partner to help provide leads for its sales reps. Aside from this, the Client wanted to help their customers save on telecom bills by introducing and offering their affordable services as an alternative to other telecom providers.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution</strong></p>\n<p>To achieve the Client’s objectives, Callbox carried out a lead generation and appointment setting campaign.</p>\n<p>Taking its cue from the Client’s instructions, Callbox agents adeptly qualified leads and set appointments and forwarded these to the Client’s sales representatives. The 3-seater campaign focused on targeting small to medium sized businesses and a few large ones. No particular number of leads was required by the Client, so Callbox, equipped with research tools and a diligent team of agents, made calls and delivered leads according to the needs of the company.</p>\n<p>The Callbox team made 160-200 calls per day for the Client. Callbox agents inquired about the current phone systems of target businesses, determined their level of contentment with their current telecom provider and asked them if they were interested in upgrading or adding features.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>Callbox generated a total of 303 leads for the Client during the 8-month campaign. Each seat successfully generated 1-2 appointments per day, 25-30 appointments per month for Client’s sales team. The Client took a break in January 2007 to digest its full pipeline and resumed partnership with Callbox.</p>\n<p>The Client ultimately profited from choosing Callbox as their outsource partner.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_IT_Callbox-Opening-Comunication-Lines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_24' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"callbox-opening-communication-lines","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"2751e394-d7f2-5576-9651-69f04aa301a0"}}
