Who could forget the impact of bands such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones during the 60s? In addition, how can we ever fail to recognize the role of Jane Austen and Graham Greene in molding the modern novel?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">If anything, these literary and musical giants post one essential fact about the UK: that it is a country that thrives on original ideas and an exceptional sense of style.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">For B2B companies wanting to engage British businesses, this fact presents a grueling challenge. They often wonder, “How on earth can we make our brands more appealing to their tastes?”</span></p>\n<h4><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Since B2B lead generation is all about building bridges and companies generally want to attract potential clients, it is vital to apply the right kind of approaches allowing these companies to engage the right kind of decision-makers in the UK market.</span></strong></h4>\n<h4><em> </em></h4>\n<h4><em><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here’s a list to start you off:</span></em></h4>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #993300;\">1). Social media engagement</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe anyone who says that social media works for the B2B industry because at any rate, it does! A </span><strong><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.webershandwick.com/uploads/news/files/socializing-your-ceo-iii-exec-summary.pdf\">study</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Weber Shandwick entitled Socialising your CEO: From Marginal to Mainstream, as much as 80% of global CEOs are engaged in social media, not discounting of course those in the UK. The report goes on to state that small and enterprise-sized businesses devote much of their time publishing their own news stories online all the while consuming someone else’s stories. Social media hands down will then be your best bet for luring high quality leads into your database. This depends however, on how you craft your social media strategy.</span></span></p>\n<p><em>Related post: <span style=\"color: #993300;\"><a style=\"color: #993300;\" title=\"Permanent Link: The Quintessential Guide to Effective Social Media Marketing\" href=\"http://www.callboxinc.com/social-media-2/the-quintessential-guide-to-effective-social-media-marketing/\" rel=\"bookmark\">The Quintessential Guide to Effective Social Media Marketing</a></span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #993300;\">2). Using data profiling in your cold call campaign</span></h1>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cold calling has always been the bane for many businesses in the UK. Strict regulations have been imposed to limit B2B telemarketing efforts, which have been known to cause </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;substantial damage or substantial distress&#8221;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as mentioned in </span><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-31616523\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> BBC report. As a result, B2B marketers are gradually abandoning the telephone as an audience engagement and audience nurturing channel altogether, in effect failing to realize the full potential of telemarketing. On the other hand, they can implement a customer profiling system not only to engage the right kind of people, but for avoiding the wrong kind of people, i.e. businesses listed under the national do-not-call registry.</span></span></p>\n<p><em>Related post:   <span style=\"color: #993300;\"><a style=\"color: #993300;\" title=\"Permanent Link: Poor Conversions?
