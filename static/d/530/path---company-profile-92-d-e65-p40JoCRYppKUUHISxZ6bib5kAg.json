With more than a decade of sales and marketing experience under its belt, Callbox has been consistently recognized as a leader in providing global market access via direct marketing, web marketing, sales support, database services and advanced salesforce management.</p>\n<h3><strong>Company History</strong></h3>\n<p>In 2004, a small business startup in downtown Los Angeles was making strides when it decided to set up operations in Iloilo, back then a sleepy little city south of Manila in the Philippines. Operations, though, were far from sluggish as Callbox started receiving calls as an inbound call center with less than 20 people that first year, and a year later, transitioned into outbound marketing. Since then, it hasn’t looked back &#8211; additional operation centers in Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, and the UK were built, further expanding its market share. Now, Callbox has over 700 employees in 2 locations (Iloilo and Davao), serving hundreds of Global 2000 companies from more than 20 countries around the world.</p>\n<h3><strong>Business Objectives</strong></h3>\n<p>Callbox is committed to delivering focused and quality sales efforts to its clients while always putting into account the unique needs of each company being served. With Callbox, a client’s business objectives and obstacles are of prime importance in uncovering the best solution, may it be in the form of putting up a stellar sales team, developing an effective selling process, or utilizing a necessary tool to increase effectiveness.</p>\n<h3>Recognitions by the Industry</h3>\n<p>Callbox has been a perennial awardee for the most part of the last decade, with honors including:</p>\n<p><strong>2008 </strong><strong>Top Outsourcer of the Year</strong></p>\n<p>1st in Percentage Growth of Sales Revenue<br />\n2nd in Number of Business-to-Business Agents<br />\nTop Outsourcer Awards, Contact Center World</p>\n<p><strong>2010Top SMO Service Provider</strong></p>\n<p>Based on Customer Satisfaction Ratings across Nine Performance Criteria<br />\nLeading Provider of Outsourced Sales and Marketing Services, The Black Book of Outsourcing</p>\n<p><strong>2011 Top 50 Teleservices Agencies</strong></p>\n<p>12th in the US Market<br />\n10th in the International Market<br />\nTop 50 Teleservices Agencies Ranking, Customer Interaction Solutions Magazine</p>\n<p><strong>2012, 2013 and 2014 Ranked No. 1 in Sales Lead Generation Services</strong></p>\n<p>Overall quality score of 9.98 out of 10<br />\nCategories: Lead Generation, Tracking, Reporting, and Help &amp; Support<br />\nTopTen Reviews, TechMedia Network</p>\n<h3>Adaptation Equals Greatness</h3>\n<p>Callbox has also been in the forefront of innovation and keeping up with the industry’s rapid advancements in technology. The company’s very own client relationship management platform, the <a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/callbox-pipeline/\"><em>Callbox Pipeline</em></a>, was developed during the company’s early years and has since flourished into a multi-functional, world-class business tool.</p>\n<p>Rom Agustin, founder and CEO of Callbox, has long been the impetus behind the company’s unwavering thirst for excellence and innovation. And he’s just getting started.</p>\n<p>“I know for a fact that Callbox will do something even more amazing and great in the years to come,” he said in his speech. “We have made so many changes to our business, our services, our tools, and to the way we project ourselves to the public eye. We constantly reinvent ourselves again and again and will continue to do so every single year in the future.”</p>\n<h3>Beyond the Business Walls</h3>\n<p>Rom has also stressed his commitment to expand the company’s corporate social responsibility into a much bigger scale. Callbox has done its share of giving back to the community through various charitable activities — something that has become part of the company’s DNA through the years — but Rom wanted something more long-term and sustainable. As part of this commitment to sustainable assistance, Callbox has launched All Above The Line, its corporate social responsibility program that aims to alleviate and eventually help to eradicate poverty in the local community.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Company Details</h3>\n<div  class='hr hr-short hr-center '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n<div style=\"overflow: auto;\">\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\">\n<h3>USA</h3>\n<p>4924 Balboa Blvd., #353<br />\nEncino, CA 91316<br />\n+1 888.810.7464 Toll free<br />\n+1 310.439.5814 Direct line<br />\n+1 310.862.6762 Fax</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\">\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk.au/\">Australia</a></h3>\n<p>Suite 83, 89-97 Jones Street<br />\nUltimo, NSW 2007 Australia<br />\n+61 1 300.505.804</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\">\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.callbox.com.sg/\">Singapore</a></h3>\n<p>No. 14 Robinson Road #13-00<br />\nFar East Finance Building<br />\nSingapore 048545<br />\n+65 6248.5023</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\">\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.callbox.com.my/\">Malaysia</a></h3>\n<p>No, 346A, Lorong Kedah, Block C<br />\nTaman Melawati, 53100<br />\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia<br />\n+60 3.2772.7370</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\">\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/\">United Kingdom</a></h3>\n<p>26 York Street, Mayfair<br />\nLondon, W1U6PZ<br />\n+44 20.74425066</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></section><br />\n<section class=\"av_textblock_section\"  itemscope=\"itemscope\" itemtype=\"https://schema.org/CreativeWork\" ><div class='avia_textblock '   itemprop=\"text\" ><p style=\"margin-left: 0px; text-align: center;\">Find out more.
