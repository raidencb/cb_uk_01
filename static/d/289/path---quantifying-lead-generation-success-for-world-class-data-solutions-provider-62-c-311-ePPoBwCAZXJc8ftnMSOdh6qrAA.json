Based in Singapore, it provides expert advice and integrated solutions for reliable and cost-effective data storage management to customers worldwide.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The Client hired a lead generation provider but needed additional support for other marketing initiatives. It looked for a reliable telemarketing partner with significant regional experience and resources in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cold call to invite participants to its open house events in Australia</li>\n<li>Profile its database and generate market feedback to improve its sales lead generation campaign</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After searching and comparing several service providers found on the internet, the Client was impressed by Callbox’s track record in B2B lead generation and immediately penned a deal.</p>\n<p><strong>The Callbox Solution </strong></p>\n<p>Callbox set up an outbound telemarketing team to initiate a call-to-invite campaign to be followed by a lead generation/client profiling campaign.</p>\n<p><em>Call-to-Invite</em><br />\nCallbox initiated a cold calling campaign to invite and sign up participants to four open house events hosted by the Client in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and Canberra. The events were organized to educate prospects and resellers in data protection solutions. The Client provided a database of 14,000 target prospects consisting of IT Managers in New Zealand and Australia.</p>\n<p>The campaign kicked off in October 2011 after email invitations were sent. Callbox provided weekly reports enabling the Client to make attendance projections and ensure good turnout.</p>\n<p><em>Lead Generation / Customer Profiling</em><br />\nAfter the success of its call-to-invite campaign, Callbox set up a telemarketing campaign to distribute free eBooks on next-generation data protection and best practices in information management. These contact opportunities were used to profile prospects, generate feedback, and gather market intelligence. The data obtained from this campaign would be used by the client to identify key prospects and opportunities which would be crucial in executing effective sales and marketing operations.</p>\n<p>Throughout the campaign, Callbox made several attempts to reach actual decision makers, which presented some challenge because operators were trained to block repeat calls. In this situation, there is no substitute for experience, and Callbox’s eight-year track record in B2B telemarketing was a key to the ultimate success of the team.</p>\n<p><strong>The Results</strong></p>\n<p>Callbox identified 165 qualified leads which far exceeded the Client’s expectations month after month. The events attracted a strong turnout which gave the Client excellent marketing opportunities and proved to be an effective market entry point.</p>\n<p>All prospects in the Client’s database were contacted and profiled resulting in a comprehensive database of sales-qualified leads which became an excellent platform for selling at senior level. With an optimized database, the Client’s salespeople were able to concentrate on the most profitable engagements and prioritize opportunities likely to be most productive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/external/casestudies/CS_IT_Quantifying-Lead-Generation-Success-for-World-Class-Data-Solutions-Provider.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3799\" src=\"http://www.callboxinc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/download_pdf.gif\" alt=\"download_pdf\" width=\"108\" height=\"59\" /></a></p>\n</div></section></div><div  class='hr hr-full hr-no-shadow '><span class='hr-inner ' ><span class='hr-inner-style'></span></span></div>\n</div></div></div><!-- close content main div --></div></div><div id='after_section_32' class='main_color container_wrap sidebar_right'   ><div class='container' ><div class='template-page content  av-content-small alpha units'><div class='post-entry post-entry-type-page post-entry-3865'><div class='entry-content-wrapper clearfix'>\n","slug":"quantifying-lead-generation-success-for-world-class-data-solutions-provider","date":"January 22, 2015"},"site":{"id":"Site","siteMetadata":{"title":"Gatsby Default Starter"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"a272890d-a379-5c46-9a67-ae17181c77ce"}}
