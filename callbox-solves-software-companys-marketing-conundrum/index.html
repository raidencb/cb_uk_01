<p>Industry: Cloud-based Communications and Security Software<br />
Location: Georgia, USA<br />
Headquarters: Georgia, USA</p>
<p>The Client is an American company offering PaaS (Platform as a Service) cloud based applications such as VoIP Services and other products including Cloud File Sharing, Cloud Email, Mobile Device Management and AV, and Secure SMS to businesses. The Client also gives them additional value by combining private and public clouds into a single, integrated environment. The company prides itself as a one-stop shop for all IT needs and specializes in secured IT platforms for companies providing next-generation services.</p>
<p>The Client is based in the state of Georgia, but covers the continental United States, targeting the Healthcare, Hotels, Retail, Law, Daycare, and Private Sector Industries.</p>
<p><b>Campaign Type:</b> Appointment Setting</p>
<p><b>Campaign Target Criteria</b></p>
<p>Location: Southeast States (Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, DC, Maryland, Kentucky, Virgina, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama)<br />
Industry: All industries<br />
Decision Makers: C-levels, IT Director/Manager</p>
<p><b>The Challenge</b></p>
<p>Despite working with a number of third party providers for their lead generation campaigns, finding interested companies to engage with their services for the long term was a challenge. Unfortunately for IPV Solutions, their previous partners were not equipped with the best tactics and tools that would scale up the sales numbers.</p>
<p>It did not help that most of their present customers may not have been the best people to take full advantage of their enterprise-ready solutions that encourage and enable mobile and global connectivity. That and the possibility that their previous partners didn’t exert enough effort to uncover the prospects’ needs such as business continuity and disaster recovery protection or continuous communications and go-anywhere mobile capabilities, which incidentally, IPV Solutions provide.</p>
<p>Hoping to find the answers to these problems, the Client searched for a reliable partner who can provide them with a list of accurate contacts and quality appointments with interested prospects who have the need for cloud integration and secured IT platforms, and who would most likely keep a long-term engagement with them.</p>
<p><b>The Callbox Solution</b></p>
<p>To address the Client’s problem about the quality of appointments, the team carried out their best effort to profile and update each contact information with each call, and took the opportunity to ask decision makers probing questions to uncover not just perceived, but actual business needs. These were significant factors in generating high converting appointments.</p>
<p>The Callbox team utilized the dependable Callbox Pipeline’s Lead Nurture Tool which efficiently automated tasks that streamlined the workflow.</p>
<p>Lead Nurture Tool’s list cleansing feature took care of contact profiling, while custom emails were automatically sent to prospects in a scheduled manner. Part of what makes this reliable tool efficient is that, every action taken by prospects like clicking a website or submitting a form is monitored in real-time and callers respond to them immediately.</p>
<p>As is always the case, all call activities were automatically logged in to the Callbox Pipeline, Callbox’s lead management and marketing automation platform where the Client can view, process or download reports of leads and/or appointments generated by Callbox agents.</p>
<p>The Callbox Pipeline’s Lead Nurture Tool made sure the call list was accurate throughout the whole campaign, while the Callbox’s SMART Calling system guaranteed to reach the right prospects at the right time, when they are most available to talk. This seamless synergy turned the operation into one a hassle-free campaign.</p>
<p><b>The Results</b></p>
<p>The initial three-month program has generated a total of 29 success calls (28 phone appointments, 1 lead). While not jaw-dropping, it was a stark departure from the meager results their previous partners have provided. Currently, the team is on its first renewal. Feedback from the client have all been positive – from the professional way the team members conduct themselves to the quality of appointments that have been set. As a result, IPV Solutions has decided to move forward for two more months with the engagement.</p>
